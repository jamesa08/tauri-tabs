# Tauri Tabs

this is a "simple" example of how to create a windowed tab system (like VS Code tabs) with Tauri in ReactJS

this makes use of CrabNebula's `drag-rs` library, and their NPM package (which is modified, under /libs/drag-window.tsx)

## running

`npm run tauri dev` to run 

built with Vite and React
